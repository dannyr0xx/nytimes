# The Task

The test is to classify New York Times articles into 21 categories. For the classification you should use two different methods (e.g.: Naive Bayes and Ridge regression) and compare the results based on their precision, recall, and F1-scores. You should also produce a figure that shows the best performing model's performance for each category. Make sure that the code is reproducible and multiple runs result in the same output.


The data is in the `data/input` folder: `nytimes.csv`. For the excercise, use a 80/20 training-test split. The classification uses the article texts as the feature set.


For the figure showing the per category results of the best model, you should use the category names. The name for each label is in the below table.
